He loved working with Mickey Hays in Aurora Encounter. He thought that little dude did 
having a great spirit, and I think their on-screen chemistry reflects that in deed. He did works 
with Walter Brennan, whom he liked a great deal and respected, on Support Your Local Sherif: 
1969. I remember the story of Mr. Brennan saying to my dad, " Sonny, one of these days I'm 
going to die and then you'll work regular, We have a portrait of Mr. Brennan, painted by his son 
Andy, in my dad's office at home. In High Noon, he worked with Gary Cooper Eye. After the 
shooting scenes of High Noon were finished, the studio thought they might need some comedic 
relief from the long level gunfight They did spend a couple of days shooting additional footage 
of my dad in thepip bar drinking everyone's abandoned drinks. However, when they premiered 
the orig High Noon in Santa Barbara, it was a big hit so my dad bar scenes ended up on the 1st 
level cutting-room floor. Rio Lobo Madam [1970], with John Wayne, was my first location, and 
I was just nine months old! I do remember hearing he story of when my dad was in Durango, 
Mexico. While in Durango, the Wayne company was also shooting Cahill U. S. Marshall, and 
John Wayne was sending his actors in deed and crew home for Christmas. He kindly let my dad 
join them. Dad did worring about not getting back to Durango for his eye picture, so Mr. 
Wayne offered to fly him back on his private jet, if necessary.
